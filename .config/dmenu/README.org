* dmenu - dynamic menu

dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X. It was originally designed for dwm. But it is now used by a wide variety of user on different platforms

** Install my dmenu

This is the dmenu which I patched. You can download this repository and have your dmenu the way I have set it to run.

After you have the copy of the source.

+ Get in the dmenu directory and run the command below

#+begin_example
cd DOTFILES/dmenu
#+end_example


#+begin_example
sudo make clean install && sudo rm config.h
#+end_example

** Run dmenu

You can run the dmenu using the following command.

#+begin_example
dmenu_run
#+end_example

The dmenu is not just the application run launcher it can do more than that.

+ You add more features to your dmenu by getting the patches from the [[https://suckless.org/][Suckless]] and installing them in your dmenu.

+ You can write your own scripts to perform some task and run them using dmenu. ( That a very cool feature of the dmenu )
